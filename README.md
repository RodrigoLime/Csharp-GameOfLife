Conway's Game of Life in C#, I made this project to practice C# a bit and also because i really like the concept of GOL.

The project implements it in the C# console, so it's a very basic version of the game. Live cells are represented as 'O' and dead cells are represented as an empty char.
It has a Main class, a Pixel class which represents a cell, and a grid class that represents a matrix of cells.
